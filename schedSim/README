Questions
For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
    When all jobs have the same burst time.
    Jobs arrive in the order of increasing burst time.
For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
    When all jobs have the same burst time and the quantum time is greater or equal to the burst time
    Jobs arrive in the order of increasing burst time. and the quantum is greater or equal to the second to last longest burst time
What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
    The response time with decrease. Because it's non-preemptive and the job lengths get longer.
    Yes, we can. In an SRTN scheduler, response time is inversely proportional. Therefore, if we increase the job length of the processes, we will see an increase in wait time; that means the response time decreases.
What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
    The response time will decrease as the quantum lengths increase.
    R = (N - 1) * q
