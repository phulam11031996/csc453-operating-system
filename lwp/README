How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library?
Can you name two ways in which the LWP library API could be improved?

Our LWP library is very simple. It only has stacks which keep track of states in
different LWPs. There is no synchronization, meaning there isn't a way to
communicate between LWPs. If two or more LWPs write to the same chunk of data,
it can cause errors. We could create functions that allow LWPs to communicate
while avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.

Additionally, the scheduler is very simple. We could implement a more
sophisticated scheduler for the library, either in a pre-emptive or cooperative
manner. Lastly, each LWP doesn't have its own local storage. We could implement
a mechanism for LWPs to have their own private data that is not shared with other LWPs
